# Intent-Recognition-Flask-Deployment
This is an Intent Recognition service with Machine Learning application. As the user enters any input sentence, the system automagically defines its intent class based on the dataset the model is trained on.  
Deployed a Keras Intent Recognition model, with blending of codes from Intent Recognition tasks, Kaggle competitions, GRU, LSTM, BERT, and SGD models

Deployed on: https://intent-cla.herokuapp.com/
